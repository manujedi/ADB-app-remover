# ADB-app-remover
I couldn't be bothered with typing/copying all the app ids anymore so i made a minimalistic gui. I use it for debloating  android devices. Can uninstall any system app using the pm uninstall -k --user 0...

Can uninstall multiple at a time. ADB required, edit the path in code if you don't have it in your default path.
